Microservices, what a topic! Everybody seems to be developing microservices, but if you ask a hundred people to describe their approach you will most likely get as many deviating answers. The reasons are many, but it all boils down to *proper education*.

Blog posts and YouTube videos can be valuable sources of information, but I've found the signal-to-noise ratio to be quite low,  so I don't spend much of my time on these. On the other hand, any work that is peer-reviewed and goes through a publishing process has a much better chance of giving a high return on investment.

In this collection I provide the complete list of Microservices books that I have found to be of good value, and I'm confident that will help you get your skills to the next level.
