In this collection you can find some legendary books that have left their mark on the industry, plus many more that can help you strengthen different angles of your career as a programmer.

Towards the end you will notice a few books about functional programming with .NET and F#, a niche that I have been working with for a few years now. At first I felt like a fish out of water, but once I got the hang of it I was able to build really cool software and improve my overall skills in software development.
