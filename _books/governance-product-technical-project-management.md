Software is everywhere; in your phone, microwave, [car](https://www.thejournal.ie/audi-chief-executive-volkswagen-4077535-Jun2018/) and [airplane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-engineers). **Everywhere**.

If your business depends on software and you have any kind of authority, you are responsible for treating software engineering with respect and making sure that you understand what it takes to utilize it efficiently and reliably. Human lives may depend on it.
