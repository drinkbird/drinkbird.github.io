Whether you are a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Architect or Manager, I guarantee that you can find something that deserves a spot in your personal book collection. Most of the books in this list I have read more than once, as the experiences I acquire between reads help me see that knowledge in a different light.

This hand-picked collection of books has helped my skyrocket my career in the Software Industry. Apart from pushing me to become a better professional, they have also inspired me to pursue personal goals and overall achieve more in life. This intro used to be much longer, but I have decided to move my thoughts on books to the end, and cut right to the chase instead.
