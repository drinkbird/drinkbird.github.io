Technical knowledge alone won't get you very far. To get anything meaningful done, you will need to work with lots of people from many different backgrounds, each having their own agenda and incentives, sometimes not even knowing (or caring) about how software development works.

Also no career comes without its ups and downs. Every now and then you might find yourself demotivated, or lacking inspiration to get creative work done. As a professional, it is your responsibility to ensure that you work output is of high quality, reliable and effective while coordinating with everyone else, no matter if you feel like it or not.

And since software development is a team sport, inspiring and influencing others is key to becoming a force multiplier and making an impact, therefore good communication and other soft skills are imperative to your growth.

In this collection you will find the books that forged me from a laborer into a professional.
