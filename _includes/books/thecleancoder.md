In this book, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) offers a comprehensive code of conduct for professional programmers, which includes disciplines, techniques, tools and practices of true software craftsmanship. It's not about code, but rather about a proper state of mind.

The wisdom contained within those pages has emerged through decades of real-world work experience, not in some vacuum. Of course you don't have to agree with everything in the book, but I guarantee that this will be one of the greatest reads you will ever come across.
