In this book, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) offers a comprehensive code of conduct for professional programmers, which includes disciplines, techniques, tools and practices of true software craftsmanship. It's not about code, but rather about the appropriate state of mind to produce high-quality code.

The wisdom contained within those pages has emerged through decades of real-world work experience, not in some vacuum. Of course you don't have to agree with everything in the book, but I guarantee that this will be one of the most useful reads you will ever come across as a software professional.
