This has been one of my favorite reads, and by far the best book about microservices out there. Chris Richardson has done a fantastic job combining theory with practical examples, while covering a wide range of patterns for Microservices from conception to execution.

Although the code examples are in Java, they can easily be mapped to whatever stack you happen to be working with. As a matter of fact I've already utilized many of the illustrated patterns in dotnet core.

If you can only pick one book about microservices, this is it.
