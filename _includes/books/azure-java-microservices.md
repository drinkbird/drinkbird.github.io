Not a book, but if you enjoy video courses I have just the thing for you.

I published this course with the intend to make it easier for people to get started with microservices, and demonstrate a number of hands-on examples that put many of the underlying concepts into perspective.

Although the code examples are in Java, you can easily map them to another stack you might be confident in (eg. dotnet core). The focus is primarily on the design of microservices, and also on the Azure cloud platform which I honestly find so valuable that I can't live without anymore.
