This is **THE** book to read about C#. It describes all of the core features of the language in great detail, from every-day-use to more advanced ones. It also provides some historical information about each of them.

I wouldn't recommend it as an introductory book on C#, as it is addressed towards more intermediate developers. [Beginning C# Object-Oriented Programming](http://geni.us/beginningcsharp) by Dan Clark would be a more suitable choice for that cause.

Jon Skeet always makes my brain melt. His deep knowledge about C# is reflected both in this book, as well as in his [Stack Overflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet).
