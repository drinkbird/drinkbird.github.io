ASP.NET Core MVC is an open-source and cross-platform web framework that promotes separation of concerns and clean code architecture. It can be directly compared to Ruby on Rails and NodeJS.

Adam Freeman, is an excellent author who never ceases to amaze me. He has a unique way of transmitting his knowledge and making it stick to the reader's mind. This book is excellent for getting you started with the MVC pattern and how it is utilized within the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. It is a must-read for anyone that works or intends to develop web applications or APIs using the Microsoft stack.
