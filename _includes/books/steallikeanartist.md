OK, this book is not actually about stealing but rather finding inspiration and fuel creativity. I've read *Steal like an artist* more than three times so far, each of them in one hit. It's short and perfect.

Software development is a highly creative process. Sometimes that creativity is greatly impaired by stress, lack of self-confidence, deadlines or extremely demanding bosses/clients. The truth is that nobody is able to force creativity, but they can certainly invite it, and that's the whole essence of this book.
