It's an extremely valuable read, not only for architects, but also for those who work with microservices or any distributed application that revolves around data.

Data is in the heart of most challenges related to systems design today. Architects have plenty of data-centric challenges to tackle, including scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. On top of that there are numerous platforms and tools that can be leveraged to achieve each project's design goals, including relational / document / graph databases, stream / batch processors, web APIs and message brokers.

Martin Kleppmann not only helps you make sense of all the buzzwords, but also guides you through this diverse landscape by doing deep dives of how each piece of technology works under the hood, what are their pros and cons, and under which circumstances it's a good idea to use them. Apart from the theory, the book comes with plenty of practical advice you can start leveraging on your day to day work right away.

As of today, this is the most well-written, comprehensive and modern book about working with data. It's destined to become a classic.
