This book was recommended by [John Papa during an interview]({{ site.url }}/john-papa-interview-voxxed-days-athens-2018/) he gave me at the Voxxed Days Athens conference.

More often than not we attempt to explain something to others, but instead of getting to the point, we sometimes give long intros and take our time. By the time we reach to the juicy bits, we have lost our audience's attention.

The book is all about getting an idea across in a short and concise fashion, in a way that will quickly capture - and resonate with - your target audience. In the era of extremely short attention spans, this technique can be a game changer for your career.
