ASP.NET MVC is an opesource web framework that promotes high-productivity and clean code architecture, and it is supported by both Microsoft and a large community of professionals. It can be directly compared to Ruby on Rails as a programming paradigm, and having developed software on both frameworks I can say with confidence that ASP.NET MVC is more fun to work with. Also, the next version of ASP.NET MVC is going to be natively supported on Linux and Mac OSX.

This is an excellent book to get your started with the MVC design pattern and how that's applied to the ASP.NET MVC framework. It is a must-read for anyone that works or intends to work with ASP.NET MVC or Web API. Adam Freeman, is an excellent author who never ceases to amaze me. He has a uniqe way of transmitting his knowledge and making it stick to the reader's mind.

For those who just can't get enough, there is also another book called [Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 Platform](http://geni.us/mvc5platform) which is essentially the second part of *Pro ASP.NET MVC 5*. It is focused on the underlying platform features, and how these can be used to build applications more effectively. It covers a plethora of important features such as user authentication, extensible request handling and state management.
