Since [ASP.NET Core MVC]({{ site.url }}/books/#aspnetcoremvc) is released and production ready, this book is now only recommended for those who still work with ASP.NET MVC 5, based on the classic .NET framework.

The MVC 5 framework has long term support from Microsoft and will still be around for years, but for any greenfield development the suggestion is to use [ASP.NET Core MVC]({{ site.url }}/books/#aspnetcoremvc).
