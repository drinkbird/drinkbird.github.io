What is legacy code? According to Michael Feathers, it's *code without tests*. Even if it was written yesterday! If you're writing legacy code for a living, this book is for you.

*The Art of Unit Testing* will get you started from zero, and teach you enough to be dangerous. You will learn about a number of different testing approaches, their pros and cons, and how to choose which one you need on a case by case basis. The examples might be in C#, but writing good tests goes beyond the programming language.
