Ah, microservices, what a topic! Everybody seems to be doing it, but in their own, "unique" ways.

Sam Newman has put together an excellent guide on microservices, explaining all the ins and outs of moving from monolithic systems to smaller, fine-grained and self-contained services. Of course this approach comes with a whole new set of practices, challenges and plenty of potential pitfalls, which the book does a great job depicting.

Whether you are already working with distributed systems, or you are planning to do in the near future, this book can put things into perspective and give you a good taste of what to expect. It also comes with plenty of external references so you can keep expanding your knowledge on specific subjects if you need to.
