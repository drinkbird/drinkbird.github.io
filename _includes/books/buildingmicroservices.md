Sam Newman has put together an excellent guide which is now considered a classic, explaining all the ins and outs of moving from monolithic systems to smaller, fine-grained and self-contained services.

I highly recommend this book, especially for those who haven't worked with microservices before or have just gotten a taste and would like to see the bigger picture.

It is a relatively short book, and I managed to finish it in less than a week. It doesn't focus on code but rather makes the case about the new set of practices, challenges and plenty of potential pitfalls that come with this given architectural style.
