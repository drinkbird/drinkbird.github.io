Uncle Bob strikes again! I had been waiting for this book for about a year, and had set high expectation. It ended up exceeding my expectations and providing value in areas of technical architecture I was completely oblivious about.

Discover what architecture is really about, and most importantly what it is *not* about. Learn the difference between architecturally critical elements and mere details. Get to know how important are layers and boundaries, and how to successfully define them. Brush up on numerous design principles for tackling function, component separation, and data management. Finally, become familiar with common architectural failures of the Industry, and figure out how prevent or face them.

Whether you are tasked with designing a new architecture or executing a design that someone else came up with, Clean Architecture is where you want to start from. It's a pleasant read that I was able to finish cover to cover within just a few days. If you haven't already, also check out the the other two book of the series, [Clean Code](https://geni.us/cleancode) and [The Clean Coder](https://geni.us/thecleancoder) (not prerequisites for reading Clean Architecture).
