This book is perhaps one of the most impactful birthday gifts I've ever received. I might not be a people manager (at least at this point in time) but making technical decisions for teams requires a fair share of human interaction which is, *ehm*, hard.

Michael Lopp has a rich management background in companies like Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Borland and Slack, and has distilled his experience in humorous and sometimes unexpected stories.

To my surprise, many of the stories felt more familiar than I'd like to admit. I got hooked and finished the book in about two weeks during my daily commute. About half a year later I got promoted, and I strongly believe that the book was instrumental to achieving that.
