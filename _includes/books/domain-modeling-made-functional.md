The Domain-Driven Design methodology has been identified as a valuable approach for modern software development, helping us tackle the complexity of our software systems and empower the collaboration between programmers and domain experts.

DDD has been traditionally associated with the Object-Oriented programming model due to a number of conceptual commonalities, such as encapsulating state within aggregate roots / bounded contexts, but it actually doesn't have to be restricted to that.

DDD and functional programming is a powerful combination that can help us model and execute upon real-world requirements in a terse and effective way, in many cases producing better results compared to an object-oriented approach.

Scott Wlaschin, the brains behind the [F# For Fun and Profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) blog, has distilled his process for creating a functional domain model into a pleasant to read, pragmatic guide. Highly recommended.
