In 2017 I started working extensively with F# and functional programming, and I can say with confidence that this is by far the best book I've read on the language.

Chris Smith gives you the down to earth, pragmatic version of what functional programming is and what isn't, and gives you the ammo you need to work effectively with F#.

You will learn about F#'s unique characteristics and core syntax, including Object Oriented and Imperative styles. You will see how you can take advantage of advanced features, such as computational expressions and tail recursion. You will become familiar with parallel and asynchronous programming; you will also figure out the difference between the two. And these are just a few of the topics covered in the book.

If you would like to find out more about F#, how it fits into the .NET ecosystem and what really makes it tick, this book is exactly what you are looking for.
