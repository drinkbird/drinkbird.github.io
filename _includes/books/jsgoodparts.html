Every language has good and bad parts, and JavaScript has its fair share of the bad. I've even heard someone referring to it as a monster that escaped from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. The truth is that if we focus on the good parts and thoroughly avoid its bad ones, JavaScript can be an excellent OOP language to work with.

In *JavaScript: The Good Parts*, Douglas Crockford outlines a great number of good ideas that make JavaScript a beautiful language, and also points out which parts should be avoided at all costs. It's a small but dense book, not necessarily easy to read, but it's definitely a must.

For those who would like to get even deeper into JavaScript, there's also [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://geni.us/jsdef) by David Flanagan.
