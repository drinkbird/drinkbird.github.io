This book made me realize, among other things, that assuring quality in software is not something that takes place towards the end of the development life cycle, but is rather a continuous effort which starts from the very beginning, at the stage of defining the problem and gathering requirements.

Concepts within the book are described using colorful metaphors so that they're easier to comprehend and simpler to explain to a non-technical audience, such as business analysts and project managers. And despite having been released for a few years now, its value is timeless.

Reading *Code Complete 2* is one of the best investments you can make if you really care about your craft.
