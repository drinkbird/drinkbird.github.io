This book made me realize, among other things, that quality assurance in software is not just a standard procedure that takes place towards the end of the development cycle, but rather a continuous effort which starts from the very beginning, at the stage of defining the problem and gathering requirements.

Its various concepts are described using colorful metaphors so that they're easier to comprehend and simpler to explain to a non-technical audience, such as stakeholders or project managers.

*Code Complete 2* is the #1 technical book I'm recommending to every software developer who truly cares about his/her craft.
