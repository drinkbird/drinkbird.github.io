Dr Venkat Subramaniam is a role model for me. I've had the privilege to discuss with him face to face for a few hours, something that made a huge impact to how I perceive and approach my career. That was even before I read this book.

Along with Andy Hunt, co-author of {% include link.html title="The Pragmatic Programmer" url="https://geni.us/pragmaticprogrammer" %}, Venkat delivers an effective high-level overview of the mindset an agile developer should have.

In software development, the devil is in the details. The desire of customers to have exactly what they want and as soon as possible, has lead to many misconceptions about the software industry. This book will arm you with valuable knowledge on how to work around such issues and improve the situation of your products and teams.
