A central idea of the book is using Design Thinking to better understand your customers and build APIs that better suit their needs.

It's not a hands-on technical book, but rather portrays the importance of understanding APIs and their landscape within your organization, explains numerous challenges they pose, and provides solid advice oh how to better manage them and build a governance story around them.

APIs are one of these components that can make or break products, teams, even whole organizations. Investing in understanding as much as you can about the subject is time well spent.
