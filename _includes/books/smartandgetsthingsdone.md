[Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky), father of [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and author of the legendary "[Joel on Software](http://joelonsoftware.com/)" blog, lays out his secrets on how to find and hire the *best* programmers.

We all know how terrible the recruiting process of most companies is. Even professional recruiting agencies are more often than not unable to evaluate talent; they mostly base their process on matching keywords or look for X years of experience on technologies that don't even exist for that long. Joel shows us how the recruting process is *meant* to be, and what recruiters and hiring managers need to do to fix it.

But you're a developer. Why would this be any of your concern? Knowing what the recruitment process is meant to be, can help you identify companies that do it right. Chances are that these companies will be great to work at. Not just because they will know their stuff, but also because your colleagues will have been hired through the same, reliable process.

On the other hand, you will also learn how to ask the right questions during the interview, and identify red flags that will help you avoid wasting time at a company that's not aligned with what you are looking for.
