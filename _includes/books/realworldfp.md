A pleasant and eye-opening introduction into the world of functional programming. The authors, both well respected for their numerous community contributions, have done a great job presenting a number of challenges and then tackling them using the functional programming model, both in C# and F#.

The book makes clear that we can work in a functional way no matter which programming language we use, although using a functional-friendly language such as F# enables us to write less verbose, more concise, and in many cases better performing applications.

This book is introductory to functional programming and F#, so you don't need any prior experience on either. On the other hand, you need to have a good background in C#.
