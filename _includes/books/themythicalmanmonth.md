Technologies may change, but people don't. This book is *legendary*. Some of the essays are dated, but others have stood the test of time and prove that some management problems have been solved decades ago and we still don't want to listen.

When I find myself in an job interview on either side of the table I usually ask the other person about this particular book. Whether they have read it or not, it's a great source of discussion points on managing software engineering projects and gives me valuable indications of what I should expect when working with that person.
