This is the bible of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It outlines all the principles involved in designing minimal, effective, appealing and delightful interfaces for interactive services and devices. It's also an ideal resource for learning about the skills required for interaction design, human computer interaction, information design, web design, and ubiquitous computing.

Anyone who is involved in the process of designing new user experiences or transforming existing ones should definitely read *Interaction Design, beyond human-computer interaction*, and most software developers are constantly involved in such activities.
