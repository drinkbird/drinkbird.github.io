When I bought this book I was looking for a pleasant mental break from technical reads, and by no means expected to hit the inspirational jackpot.

Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios will take you to a journey of creativity, decision making, team building and impressive insights from his long and rewarding career.

The book has been the source for my blog post [Which is more valuable: Good ideas or good people?]({{ site.url }}/people-vs-ideas) and a whole list of ideas to write about in the future.
