An excellent book from a fantastic author, which became an instant classic the moment it hit the shelves.

John Sonmez does a great job in providing quality advice and unique insights on numerous topics such as career development, personal branding, learning, productivity, finance, even fitness and psychology. It is broken down into many small chapters, which make it easier to read and digest.

I was totally amazed by Soft Skills. It gave me a fresh perspective on professionalism and life in general, and encouraged me to become a better version of myself while thriving as a programmer.

If you have already read and enjoyed Soft Skills, make sure to check out John's newest hit, [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide]({{ site.url }}/books/#careerguide).
