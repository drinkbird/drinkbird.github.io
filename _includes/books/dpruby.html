Russ Olsen has done a great job at adapting fourteen commonly-used GoF design patterns to the Ruby language. He doesn't just list the patterns one by one, rather he presents a real-world problem, builds an initial solution for it, outlines its shortcomings, and then refactors it using design patterns.

It is a must-read for anyone who programs either in Ruby or in any other dynamically-typed language, such as Javascript. Also, the first two chapters provide a comprehensive introduction to Ruby, so the reader doesn't need any prior Ruby experience in order to start reading the book.
