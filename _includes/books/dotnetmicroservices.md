Despite being targeted to dotnet core, I found the theory in this book to be exceptionally well presented and independent of the stack.

Now if you happen to work with dotnet core and/or the Azure cloud platform, this is a must-read as you have the additional benefit of using the code examples directly and learn new things about the platform.

It's also free to download, so can easily skim through it and verify whether the content looks valuable to you.
