The title is a bit misleading. This book is not so much about the act of releasing software, but rather designing systems that you feel comfortable releasing.

It's a common trap to design a system and focus only on the happy paths, but that's only the first (and often easiest) step. Good software is reliable, resilient, and ready to overcome a series of difficulties that may arise.

The book is thought-provoking, engaging, and full of real-world experiences that can really change the way you think about delivering working software.
