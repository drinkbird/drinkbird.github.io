Automated tests are right at the center of agile software development and the DevOps culture. Tests have your back, and given they are done right, they can help you move faster and more effectively by taking huge risks out of the equation.

This book by Gerard Meszaros is the bible of software automated testing, and can greatly help you step-up your engineering game. It describes a total of 68 well-defined patterns for writing better, more readable, and much more maintainable tests. It also depicts a number of common code *smells* of automated tests, and provides detailed guidance on how to refactor and end up with a good solution.

There are code samples in several programming languages, and although the book is focused on the xUnit family of testing frameworks, the patterns and practices it contains apply to several other modern testing frameworks, such as *NUnit*, *RSpec*, *JBehave*, *Fit* and  *Fitnesse*.
