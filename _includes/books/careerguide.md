I've been following John Sonmez's work for quite some time now, and he never ceases to amaze me. This book is no exception.

Technical knowledge alone is not enough for having a successful and fulfilling career, so this book touches pretty much every aspect of a developer's life except actual programming. John's engaging words will help you create a career roadmap, including solid advice on how to plan and execute. 

It is a massive 796 pages-long book, comprized of bite-sized chapters that are easy to read and pleasant to digest. If you enjoyed his other masterpiece, [Soft Skills]({{ site.url }}/books/#softskills), you will love this one as it's an extensive deep dive into even more soft skill topics.

I'm confident that you will find value in this book regardless of your level of experience. Whether you are just starting or you are a veteran programmer, there will be lots of good information to build your future decisions upon. It's also one of the best gifts you can make to a fellow programmer.
