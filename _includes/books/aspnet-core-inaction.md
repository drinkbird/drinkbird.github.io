ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform and [high-performance](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) framework, ideal for building cloud-based, internet-connected applications, from REST APIs to full stack applications. It be directly compared to Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and Spring. Having developed solutions on all of these frameworks, I find that I'm much more productive and happy with ASP.NET Core.

I had been following [Andrew Lock's excellent blog](https://andrewlock.net/) on ASP.NET Core for a while when his book got published, and I immediately knew that I had to read it. I finished it in about a week, learned a ton of new things, and managed to directly apply some of that practical knowledge to a real-world enterprise application. Win!

PS: The usual language to develop on ASP.NET Core is C#, but the framework also [works nicely with F#](https://github.com/drinkbird/Ireland-Luas-Forecasting-API).
