The prelude to the DevOps Handbook is a humorous novel that will entertain you and and leave you with lots to think about.

Our protagonist, Bill, is tasked with delivering a project critical to the future of the business. But The Phoenix Project is already over budget and past its deadline. Bill has just 90 days to deliver it, otherwise his whole department will be outsourced.

The story's characters are sort of exaggerated representations of people you meet and interact with in real companies, facing the usual IT problems; mismanaged projects, managers with personal agendas, arbitrary and unachievable deadlines, and above all the failure to understand and respond to customer needs.

Bill's quest will reveal a number of approaches and tools which essentially are the basis of DevOps. Although in real world scenarios the adoption of such ideas would take significantly longer compared to the book, the lessons are clear and important.
