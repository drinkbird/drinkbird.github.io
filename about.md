## Background

My name is Anastasios Piotopoulos and I'm a passionate software engineer, specialized in web and cloud technologies, having a lifelong mission of solving problems through building high-quality software. I also love inspiring others to do the same.

As an advocate of the Agile Software Development and the Software Craftsmanship Movement, my passion is the proper design of software while making meaningful business decisions, avoiding unnecessary technical debt and focusing on code readability, robustness, testability and extensibility. Over the years I have been involved in the construction of everything from small utilities to enterprise-scale cloud solutions.

Furthermore, I have been a guest speaker at various tech industry events, community meetups and academic lectures. I truly enjoy presenting and speaking about software craftsmanship, clean code, design patterns, development productivity, the lean methodology and much more.

## Too much information

#### Technologies

One of the most important principles I live by is being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis. Today, I usually work with C#, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript and Azure Cloud Services, although I also enjoy working in Java and Ruby. Tomorrow, it might be something completely different, who knows?

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> - _**Individuals and interactions**_ over processes and tools
> - _**Working software**_ over comprehensive documentation
> - _**Customer collaboration**_ over contract negotiation
> - _**Responding to change**_ over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
