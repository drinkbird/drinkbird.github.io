## Background

My name is Anastasios Piotopoulos and I'm a passionate software engineer, focused on the web & the cloud. I've been building software almost since I remember myself, starting with [GW Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). Today, I specialize in solution architecture with C# / .NET and Azure Cloud Services, although I'm also comfortable in Javascipt, Java and Ruby. 

I mostly blog about [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship). My passion is the proper design of software before even writing a single line of code, avoiding unnecessary technical debt and focusing on performance, testability, re-usability and maintainability. I always prefer being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis. I also really enjoy presenting and speaking. I have been a speaker in Microsoft workshop events about Cloud Architecture patterns, practices and use cases. Giving back to the community is one of the most satisfying aspects of software engineering. 

Nowadays you'll find me in Dublin, Ireland where I'm pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Software Engineering & Ubiquitous Computing at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/).

## Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship
> Raising the bar
> 
> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
> - Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
> - Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
> - Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships
>
> That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
> [Sign the manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) if you agree.
