## Background

I'm Anastasios (Tasos) Piotopoulos. I currently live in Dublin, Ireland with my fiance, my laptop, and a huge stockpile of coffee. I've been writing code almost since I remember myself, starting with [GW Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). I specialize in solution architecture, C# / .NET and Azure Cloud Services, mostly developing enterprise line-of-business applications, although I'm also confortable in Java and Ruby. I have about five years of experience in a professional environment and I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Software Engineering & Ubiquitous Computing at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/). Finally, I have recently acquired the title of [MCSD: Web Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-au/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx).

I consider myself a fairly experienced software engineer, focused on the web & the cloud. My passion is the proper design of the software before even writing a single line of code, avoiding unnecessary technical debt and focusing on performance, testability, re-usability and maintainability. Application life cycle management in an agile environment is also an exciting challenge. In my humble opinion there is no such thing as *best tool* or *best practice*, as context always matters. I prefer being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis.

Finally, I really enjoy presenting and speaking. I have been a speaker in Microsoft workshop events about Cloud Architecture patterns, practices and use cases. I strive to be an active member of the IT community, as I strongly believe that the software industry should be all about communication and experience sharing.

## What on earth is the DrinkBird?

As you might have guessed by now, the DrinkBird is me. It's a literal translation of my last name, from Greek to English. Coincidentally, it also aligns with my love for coffee.

*The DrinkBird logo was designed by [SugarBird Creative](http://sugarbird.gr/), an excellent graphics designer agency, highly-experienced in branding and storytelling.*
