## Background

I'm Tasos Piotopoulos, a force multiplier for software delivery teams. As a technical lead I have a track record of solving complex problems through delivering high-quality solutions, and a passion for helping others grow professionally. While working in the Tech Industry since 2005, I have been personally responsible for both making and saving tens of millions of dollars for my customers and employers, a number that only keeps growing.

I currently work at [Walmart Global Tech](https://walmart.com)ยน (former [Jet.com](https://jet.com)) in Dublin, Ireland, as a Technical Lead, successfully delivering numerous large-scale enterprise projects within the Supply Chain and Market Intelligence organizations, while leading engineering teams of many sizes. I also hold a Master's degree is in Software Engineering and Ubiquitous Computing from University College Dublin.

Technology-wise, I mostly focus on Cloud-Native Distributed Systems in conjunction with Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps practices. Over the years I have delivered projects using a variety of practices, languages, platforms, libraries, and tools, such as Microservices, Event Sourcing, Domain Driven Design (DDD), JVM & .NET based languages (Scala, Java, F#, C#), cloud / DS technologies (Azure, GCP, Kafka, Kafka Connect, Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, Nomad, CI/CD, Hadoop / HIVE, Spark, Flink), and mobile technologies (iOS, Android), just to name a few.

In addition, I blog at drinkbird.com, publish online courses, organize technology meetups and workshops, speak at events and academic lectures, and read lots of books to help me grow further.

ยน Walmart is a [Fortune 1](http://fortune.com/fortune500/) company

### What is this blog about?

As technology professionals we are constantly pushed towards producing more and faster. When performing under pressure we tend to cut corners, make tradeoffs that we can't really afford, and generally we treat quality as an afterthought.

That works for a while, but soon reality catches up; instead of providing value by solving business problems, we waste our time and energy dealing with defects and regressions. Eventually, productivity grants to a halt and even the smallest change becomes a risky, expensive challenge. Exhausted from burnouts, we escape by hopping to a new job, only to find ourselves in the middle of yet another death march.

We can do better.

In this blog I distill some of my thoughts and experiences from the Tech Industry and literature, as well as present some practical guides and tutorials, with the intent to motivate, inspire, and help both new and seasoned technology professionals to cultivate both their technical and soft skills. The Industry is shaped by each of us, and any improvement, either big or small, can go a long way.
