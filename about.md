## Background
I'm Anastasios (Tasos) Piotopoulos, a passionate software engineer &amp; aspiring technical architect (M.Sc.) who offers guidance and tutorials for technology professionals. I write this blog, organize meetups and workshops, speak at events and academic lectures, and solve complex problems through delivering high-quality software.

Over the years I have been involved in the construction of everything from simple tooling to enterprise cloud-native solutions. I have a Master's degree in Software Engineering and Ubiquitous Computing from University College Dublin, and I currently work at [Jet.com](https://jet.com) and [Walmart.com](https://walmart.com)ยน as a Senior Software Engineer.

#### What is this blog about?

As technology professionals we are constantly pushed towards producing more and faster. When performing under pressure we tend to cut corners, make tradeoffs that we can't really afford, and generally we treat quality as an afterthought. That works for a while, but soon reality catches up; instead of providing value by solving business problems, we waste our resources and energy dealing with defects and regressions. Eventually, productivity grants to a halt and even the smallest change becomes a risky, expensive challenge. Exhausted from burnouts, we escape by hopping to a new job, only to find ourselves in the middle of yet another death march.

It's not meant to be that way. We can do better.

In this blog I distill some of my thoughts and experiences from the tech industry and literature, with the intent to motivate and inspire both new and seasoned techies to actively plan and manage their professional life, reinforce both their technical and soft skills, and help them become the best version of themselves.

#### Technologies

One of the principles I live by is being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis. During my career I have delivered projects using a variety of languages, platforms, libraries and tools, such as C#/F#/.NET, Scala, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Objective C, iOS, Android, Dynamics CRM, Kafka, Consul, Docker, Nomad and more.

During the last few years I've been mostly working with distributed systems, Microservices, Event Sourcing, Domain Driven Design, and architectural patterns for the cloud, mostly around resiliency, scalability and testing. Lately, I've been exploring functional programming with F# and Scala, and have been working towards combining the best of both worlds (OOP & FP).

#### Speaking and Workshops

Giving back to the community is one of the most rewarding activities of a Software Industry professional. Although blogging is something I greatly enjoy, you will also find me speaking at various events, academic lectures and community meetups. Furthermore, I organize [Angular Dublin](https://www.meetup.com/AngularJSDublin/), one of the most popular technology meetups in Ireland.
