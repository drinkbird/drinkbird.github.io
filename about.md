## Background

I'm Tasos Piotopoulos, a force multiplier for software teams. As a software engineering lead & aspiring technical architect (M.Sc.), I have a track record of building hassle-free enterprize cloud solutions and a passion for helping others step up their engineering game.

I blog at drinkbird.com, produce online courses, organize meetups and workshops, speak at events and academic lectures, and solve complex problems through delivering high-quality software.

My Master's degree is in Software Engineering and Ubiquitous Computing from University College Dublin, and I currently work at [Walmart Labs](https://walmart.com)ยน (former [Jet.com](https://jet.com)) in Dublin - Ireland as a Technical Lead (ECB5 Staff Software Engineer). 

ยน Walmart is a [Fortune 1](http://fortune.com/fortune500/) company

### Technologies

One of the principles I live by is being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis. During my career I have delivered projects using a variety of languages, platforms, libraries and tools, such as .NET & JVM based languages (F#, C#, Scala, Java), cloud / distributed systems technologies (Azure, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, Nomad, CI/CD), mobile technologies (iOS, Android), just to name a few.

During the last few years I've been mostly working with distributed systems within a DevOps culture, including Microservices, Event Sourcing, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Test Driven Development (TDD), and quality cloud architectural patterns to increase resiliency, scalability, observability and testability.

Lately, I've been exploring functional programming with Scala and F#, and have been working towards combining the best of both worlds (OOP & FP), while leading a small team to deliver high-quality modern systems within Walmart.

### Speaking and Workshops

Giving back to the community is one of the most rewarding activities of a Software Industry professional. Although blogging is something I greatly enjoy, you will also find me speaking at various events, academic lectures and community meetups. Furthermore, I organize [Angular Dublin](https://www.meetup.com/AngularJSDublin/), one of the most popular technology meetups in Ireland.

### What is this blog about?

As technology professionals we are constantly pushed towards producing more and faster. When performing under pressure we tend to cut corners, make tradeoffs that we can't really afford, and generally we treat quality as an afterthought.

That works for a while, but soon reality catches up; instead of providing value by solving business problems, we waste our time and energy dealing with defects and regressions. Eventually, productivity grants to a halt and even the smallest change becomes a risky, expensive challenge. Exhausted from burnouts, we escape by hopping to a new job, only to find ourselves in the middle of yet another death march.

We can do better.

In this blog I distill some of my thoughts and experiences from the Tech Industry and literature, as well as present some practical guides and tutorials, with the intent to motivate, inspire, and help both new and seasoned technology professionals to cultivate their technical and soft skills. The Industry is shaped by each of us, so every improvement - either big or small - can go a long way.

### Why DrinkBird?

It's the direct translation of my last name, from Greek to English.
