## Background

I'm Anastasios (Tasos) Piotopoulos, a passionate software engineer and aspiring technical architect with a lifelong mission of solving complex problems through building high-quality software.

Over the years I have been involved in the construction of everything from simple tooling to enterprise cloud-native solutions, and through that experience it has become clear that successful software systems are grown and forged through myriads of decisions, often made by many different people.

My passion, therefore, lies in working with a principled team that understands this process, has a strong sense of responsibility and collective ownership, knows how to avoid waste and unnecessary technical debt, and also highly focuses on code readability, robustness, testability and extensibility.

#### What is this blog about?

The software industry continuously pushes us towards producing more, and faster, often disregarding quality. That's when priorities get blurry, corners get cut, and mediocre software comes into life. Then instead of solving interesting problems, teams waste their time and energy fighting with bugs and production issues, until technical debt becomes impossible to repay and projects go bankrupt.

As software professionals we need to be principled, have engineering discipline, be ready to fight for the long term success of our projects, stop counting productivity by the lines of committed code, and start seeing the bigger picture.

In this blog I distill some of my knowledge from the industry and literature, in hope to motivate and inspire both new and seasoned programmers to be the best versions of themselves and excel in the industry.

#### Technologies

One of the principles I live by is being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis. During my career I have delivered projects using a variety of languages, platforms, libraries and tools, such as C#/F#/.NET, Scala, Kafka, Containers, JavaScript / TypeScript, Java, Ruby, python, Objective C, iOS, Android, Dynamics CRM and more.

During the last few years I've been mostly working with distributed systems, Microservices, Event Sourcing, Domain Driven Design, and architectural patterns for the cloud, mostly around resiliency, scalability and testing. Lately, I've been exploring functional programming with F# and Scala, and have been working towards combining the best of both worlds (OOP & FP).

#### Community involvement

Giving back to the community is one of the most rewarding activities of a software professional. Blogging is something I greatly enjoy, although you will also find me speaking at various events, academic lectures and community meetups. I'm also organizer of [AngularJS Dublin](https://www.meetup.com/AngularJSDublin/), one of the largest technology meetups in Dublin, hosted at Google's Headquarters.
