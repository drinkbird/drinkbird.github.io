### Background

Hello, I'm Tasos Piotopoulos! As a Lead Software Engineer, I function as a force multiplier for software delivery teams. My multifaceted role encompasses hands-on coding, steering technical architecture, and guiding engineers to achieve their fullest potential. Since entering the tech scene in 2005, I've tackled complex challenges and delivered high-quality solutions across a diverse set of industries. But my efforts go beyond just the technical aspects; I'm deeply invested in developing professionals in both their hard and soft skills.

Leading engineering teams of various sizes, I've overseen technology projects that have either saved or generated tens of millions of dollars for businesses ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. Armed with a Master's degree in Software Engineering and Distributed Systems from University College Dublin, I also apply academic rigor to tackle real-world problems.

In terms of technical expertise, my skill set spans Cloud-Native Distributed Systems, Site Reliability Engineering, and DevOps practices. Throughout my career, I've been hands-on with multiple programming languages such as Scala, Java, F#, and C#, and familiarized myself with key tools and platforms like Azure, GCP, AWS, MongoDB Atlas, Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes.

But the quest for growth isn't solely a personal mission; I aim to uplift others along the way. Through blogging, creating online courses, hosting tech meet-ups, and speaking at various platforms, I'm committed to sharing valuable insights and experiences. Let's connect and learn together.

### What is this blog about?

The tech landscape is not just about code; it's about leadership, too. You don't have to choose between being a great engineer and an inspiring leader — you can be both. In a profession where speed often trumps quality and shortcuts are the norm, it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. And all too often, we find ourselves mired in technical debt, team burnout, and dwindling productivity.

This stops here.

Welcome to a blog dedicated to empowering engineers to lead, in code and in character. Here, you'll find not just tutorials and technical guides but also advice on soft skills, leadership, and career growth. Whether you're a new graduate or a seasoned pro, there's something here to help you level up both your technical expertise and your ability to inspire and guide a team.

Your transformation into a tech leader starts now. Ready to join the journey? You're in the right place.
