## Background

My name is Anastasios Piotopoulos and I'm a software engineer, focused on the web & the cloud. I currently live in Dublin, Ireland with my fiance, my laptop and a huge stockpile of coffee. I've been writing code almost since I remember myself, starting with [GW Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). I specialize in solution architecture, C# / .NET and Azure Cloud Services, mostly developing enterprise line-of-business applications, although I'm also comfortable in Java and Ruby. I have about five years of experience in a professional environment and I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Software Engineering & Ubiquitous Computing at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/). Also, I have recently acquired the title of [MCSD: Web Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-au/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx). 

I mainly blog about quality in software, including every phase of the software lifecycle, from conception to maintenance. My passion is the proper design of the software before even writing a single line of code, avoiding unnecessary technical debt and focusing on performance, testability, re-usability and maintainability. In my humble opinion there is no such thing as *best tool* or *best practice*, as context always matters. I prefer being pragmatic rather than dogmatic and [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob) on a case-by-case basis.

Finally, I really enjoy presenting and speaking. I have been a speaker in Microsoft workshop events about Cloud Architecture patterns, practices and use cases. Giving back to the community is one of the most satisfying aspects of software engineering. You can find more at my [Linkedin profile](http://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.owner.linkedin }}).

## What on earth is the DrinkBird?

As you might have guessed by now, the DrinkBird is me. It's a literal translation of my last name, from Greek to English. Coincidentally, it also aligns with my love for coffee.

*The DrinkBird logo was designed by [SugarBird Creative](http://sugarbird.gr/), an excellent graphics designer agency, highly-experienced in branding and storytelling.*
