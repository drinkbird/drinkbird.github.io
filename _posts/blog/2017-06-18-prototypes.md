Prototyping is a standard approach to evaluating an idea. While prototyping we can test various assumptions, reveal hidden risks, make corrective actions at a much reduced cost, and even assess the overall viability of a given idea.

We tend to think of prototypes as being code-based, but that's not always the case. For example, we can create a user interface concept using post-it notes, a low-fidelity mockup using a paint program, or even a high-fidelity interactive mockup using a specialized tool such as [proto.io](https://proto.io/).

On the other hand, when a prototype is facilitated using real code, 


when a prototype *is* code-based things can get quite complicated, especially when it comes to managing expectations. 



It's when prototypes are code-based that things become interesting.

Sometimes we need to get as close to the real thing as possible.

Treating prototype code as production-ready is dangerous and wrong

Prototyping is a learning experience performed to expose risk and answer questions.
