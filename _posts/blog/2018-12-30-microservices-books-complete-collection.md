Microservices, what a topic!

Everybody seems to be developing microservices, but if you ask a hundred people to describe their approach you will most likely get as many deviating answers.

The reasons are many, but it all boils down to *proper education*.

Blog posts and YouTube videos can be valuable sources of information, but I've found the signal-to-noise ratio to be quite low,  so I don't spend much of my time on these.

On the other hand, any work that is peer-reviewed and goes through a publishing process has a much better chance of giving a high return on investment.

In this post I provide the complete list of Microservices books that I have found to be of good value, and I'm confident that will help you get your skills to the next level.

## Conclusion

These resources can keep you happily busy for months, and depending on your reading pace, it could be much more than a full year. A good goal would be roughly one book per month, or two months.

My advice is, carve out between 30 or 60 minutes of reading a day, maybe while commuting or during lunch, and I can guarantee that you will start noticing a big performance difference at work very soon.
