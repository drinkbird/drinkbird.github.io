As discussed in the [previous article](http://blog.drinkbird.com/aspnet-mvc-angular-razor-templates/) of this series, blending a delivery framework such as ASP.NET MVC,
with a full-blown client framework like Angular, can lead to some truly impressive results. In the ASP.NET ecosystem though, apart from MVC, there's also
[Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api), a framework used to build RESTful-style web services that can be easily consumed from a broad range of clients,
such as web browsers and mobile devices.

Web API's programming paradigm is quite similar to MVC, and the two frameworks actually complement each other, especially when used in combination with Angular.



Since the latter is exceptional at 



MVC can be used for serving
[Razor templates](http://blog.drinkbird.com/aspnet-mvc-angular-razor-templates/), bundling and minifying JS and CSS files, hosting the master page(s), as well as
applying authentication and authorization restrictions per page or per feature. Angular can be used for implementing each individual page, performing web requests
and adding interactivity to the browser. 








 For CRUD operations through (Create, Read, Update, Delete), Web API is faster and more
lightweight. Responses from Web API include an HTTP status code, and optionally some data in a computer readable format (usually JSON or XML). 





 On the other hand, Web API is fast and lightweight can handle all CRUD-related operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
It's fast and lightweight, since data is transfered in pure JSON or XML format,

there is also Web API, which is another
delivery framework that instead of serving HTML pages, it exposes REST-ful style APIs that serve data.




In the .NET world though, there is another delivery framework
that works independently or alongside with ASP.NET MVC and delivers REST-ful style APIs.  




Almost every modern web application is comprised of an ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, some living on the server side and some on the client side.
Securing such an application is a complicated process which involves an orchestration of actions on both sides.
For applications using ASP.NET MVC and Web API as delivery frameworks, and Angular as a client framework, there is a number of features that
can be effectively combined in order to improve security and mitigate some very dangerous attacks.





Furthermore, since Angular is designed to handle AJAX requests
elegantly, using
