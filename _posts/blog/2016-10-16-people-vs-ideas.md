# What is wrong with this picture?

"I have a great idea for a startup". How often do you hear this phrase? How many people have pitched their idea to you, in hope that you will put your efforts into their startup?

Traditionally, startups revolve around some *million dollar* idea, something *disruptive* and *innovative* that can *make the world a better place*. Yet pitch after pitch, I couldn't help it but feel that something is very wrong with this picture.

Although I'm a passionate supporter of innovation, it was something about those people's approach that felt off. I couldn't tell exactly what that was, until I stumbled upon a truly great read from Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios.


# Where do good ideas come from?

In his book, [Creativity, Inc.](http://geni.us/creativityincbook), Catmull tells an interesting story where during his talks he'd ask his audience the following question: "Which is more valuable: good ideas or good people?". In other words, "Would you rather have a great team, or a great idea?".

Interestingly enough, with any type of audience, the responses were always split 50-50, with half of the people prefering the one over the other. Statisticians will tell you that having such a perfect split doesn't mean that half know the right answer. It means that they are picking at random, they are guessing, as if they were flipping a coin.

After years of asking the same question, only one person in an audience has ever pointed out the false dilemma:

> To me, the answer should be obvious: **Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas**. Why are we confused about this?
>
> Because too many of us think of ideas as being **singular**, as if they float in the ether, fully-formed and independent of the people who wrestle with them.
>
> Ideas, though, are not singular. They are **forged** through tens of thousands of decisions, often made by dozens of **people**.

Catmull continues,

> Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.

Eureka!


# Strong ventures are build around strong teams

We already saw that getting the team right is the fundamental predecessor to getting the ideas right. I'm sure your common sense is tingling right now, but there's more to the story. 

Everybody wants talented people on their team, that's something easy to say, but the real key is how these people *interact* with one another. Even the smartest people can form ineffective teams if they are mismatched.

Instead of focusing on the talents of individuals, it's better focus on *how* a team is operating. Great teams are comprised of people who *complement* each other. That's something that reinforces the point made above:

> Getting the right people **and** the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.

When someone asks you to join a startup, they tend to focus solely on your talents, knowledge, and accomplishments listed in your resume, rather than on your character and values. Naturally the same approach is followed for the rest of the team, which you usually meet only after you have already agreed to join the venture.

What are the chances for that team to be something more than mediocre?


# Singular leaders are dangerous

Apart from focusing on the wrong things while recruiting, these people have something else in common: they identify too closely with their idea. Naturally, every founder would prefer to be told that his or her idea is genius. By identifying themselves too closely with their idea, they make themselves prone to taking offence when that idea is challenged.

As previously discussed, great ideas are never formed in a vacuum. Also, most successful products are not a result of a single idea. In fact, they are compised of a multitude of ideas, contributed by many different people.

In his book, [The Lean Startup](http://geni.us/leanstartup), Eric Ries urges enterpreneurs to create a minimum viable product and use it as a subject of rapid experimentation clarify whether their hypothesis or vision is true or not. Then, depending on the findings, they need to pivot or persevere, and repeat the whole process over and over again. Examine any number of successful startups and you will easily verify that the final form of their product or service is quite different from its original conception.

Therefore, those who identify too closely with their idea are setting themselves - and their team - up for failure. Chances are that their egos will make them blind to shifting dynamics and deaf to meaningful feedback, if that feedback somehow opposes their original idea.

> Great ideas are never found in the genius mind of a singular leader who has the charisma, or brutality, to force his will into existence.

naturally every director would prefer to be told that his film is a masterpiece 

flaws are apparent or revisions are needed.

You are not your idea and if you identify too closely with your ideas you will take offence when they are challenged. to setup a healthy feedback system you must remove power dynamics

focus on the problem not the person.


be alert to shifting dynamics, your future depends on it





If you think about it, most successful products are not a result of a single idea, but a multitude of them. 

quality is the best business plan. quality is not a consequence of following some set of behaviors but rather 



# Identifying the patterns

As it turns out, the vast majority of successful startups share some common characteristics:

* they are built around strong teams, and
* the final form of their product or service is quite different than its original conception
