# What is wrong with this picture?

"I have a great idea for a startup". How often do you hear this phrase? How many people have pitched their idea to you, in hope that you will put your efforts into their startup?

Traditionally, startups revolve around some *million dollar* idea, something *disruptive* and *innovative* that can *make the world a better place*. Yet pitch after pitch, you can't help it but feel that something is very wrong with this picture.

I couldn't really tell what exactly felt off, until I stumbled upon a truly great explanation by Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios.


# Where do good ideas come from?

In his book, [Creativity, Inc.](http://geni.us/creativityincbook), Catmull describes an interesting story where during his talks he'd ask his audience the following question: "Which is more valuable: good ideas or good people?". In other words, "Would you rather have a great team, or a great idea?".

Interestingly enough, and with any type of audience, the responses were always split 50-50, with half of the people prefering the one over the other. Statisticians will tell you that having such a perfect split doesn't mean that half know the right answer. It means that they are picking at random, they are guessing, as if they were flipping a coin.

After years of asking the same question, only one person in an audience has ever pointed out the false dilemma:

> To me, the answer should be obvious: **Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas**. Why are we confused about this?
>
> Because too many of us think of ideas as being **singular**, as if they float in the ether, fully-formed and independent of the people who wrestle with them.
>
> Ideas, though, are not singular. They are **forged** through tens of thousands of decisions, often made by dozens of **people**.

Catmull continues,

> Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.

Eureka!


# What do successful startups have in common?





naturally every director would prefer to be told that his film is a masterpiece 

flaws are apparent or revisions are needed.

You are not your idea and if you identify too closely with your ideas you will take offence when they are challenged. to setup a healthy feedback system you must remove power dynamics

focus on the problem not the person.


be alert to shifting dynamics, your future depends on it


quality is the best business plan. quality is not a consequence of following some set of behaviors but rather 


Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.




"Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better."






Thus, getting the team right is the fundamental predecessor to getting the ideas right. Everybody wants talented people in their team, 


If you think about it, most successful products are not a result of a single idea, but a multitude of them. 






# Identifying the patterns

As it turns out, the vast majority of successful startups share some common characteristics:

* they are built around strong teams, and
* the final form of their product or service is quite different than its original conception
