# What is wrong in this picture?

"I have a great idea for a startup". How often do you hear this phrase? How many people have pitched their idea to you, in hope that you will put your efforts into their startup?

Traditionally, startups revolve around some *million dollar* idea, something *disruptive* and *innovative* that can *make the world a better place*. Yet pitch after pitch, you can't help it but feel that something is very wrong with this picture.

I couldn't really tell what exactly felt off, until I stumbled upon a truly great explanation by Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios.


# Where do good ideas come from?

In his book, [Creativity, Inc.](http://geni.us/creativityincbook), Catmull describes an interesting story where during his talks he'd ask his audience the following question: "Which is more valuable: good ideas or good people?". In other words, "would you rather have a great team, or a great idea?". Interestingly enough, and with any type of audience, the responses were always split 50-50, with half of the people prefering the one over the other.

Statisticians will tell you that having such a perfect split doesn't mean that half know the right answer. It means that they are picking at random, they are guessing, as if they were flipping a coin.








# Identifying the patterns

As it turns out, the vast majority of successful startups share some common characteristics:

* they are built around strong teams, and
* the final form of their product or service is quite different than its original conception
