Earlier this year I attended the Voxxed Days Athens conference and had the pleasure to meet [John Papa](https://johnpapa.net/).

After his inspiring keynote talk about readable code, I got to pick John's brain and get some wonderful career advice, which I'm excited to be sharing with you. 

From online courses to podcasts and coding style guides, John's contributions to the dev community always stand out and provide great value, and this interview is no exception.

## On building a team

Since my friend and co-organizer of the [Angular Dublin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AngularJSDublin/), [Simona Cotin](https://twitter.com/simona_cotin), joined John's team last year, I've been hearing nothing but the best comments.

Knowing how hard it is to pick a good team, or even harder to actually build one, this feedback intrigued me and so I asked John to tell us a few things about his approach.

**John Papa**: *My philosophy on building a team is a little different than some people's maybe. This may not work for everybody.*

*When I build a team I first look for technology skills, what am I trying to build it for. That is one piece of it, but it's not everything.*

*I also look for people that are less experienced and people who are more experienced. I like to have a variety of that, because I feel that we get different things when you've been coding for twenty years versus coding for five years. There's different ways you look at things sometimes and it's nice to have that diversity.*

*Also different technologies, I like to have not just one technology.*

*I look for people who don't necessarily agree with me, who have a different point of view on things. While it's great for somebody to say "I love this, I love that, I agree with you", you're not getting another perspective. So hearing a different perspective, but also being able to give that perspective in a nice, communicative way. We don't want to fight, we want people who can talk about things and learn.*

*Also I'll say diversity but I don't mean necessarily just "male, female, young, less experienced, everything else"; I mean more diversity of thought, diversity of culture, diversity of experience.*

*For example, Simona has got a background working for large companies and she did some consulting. Another gentleman on our team worked at a large company for a small career. Another person was a teacher on my team - used to teach students. And another person on our team was a manager of developer relations. So we just got this variety of people who like to do different things.*

*And in developer relations I always tell my team "don't look at other people doing the job to figure what you should do". It's very easy to say "Oh, I like what John Papa is doing, what Simona Cotin is doing, I'll do that".*

> *Find what you're best at, find what you enjoy the most, what your passion is, find what you can get paid for, and when you have those three things and you can find somewhere that has all three, that's the best place to be.*

*So when you're looking for a job, or when you're looking to hire people, I ask people not what they know but I ask what they enjoy the most.*

*Like, Simona really likes to speak on stage. We have another gentleman, Burke, who loves to write and he came to me early in the job asking "I'm doing videos, I'm writing code, I'm writing articles, I'm doing talks, I'm building a product. I feel like I'm doing too many things, which one should I work on?". I said "What do you enjoy?", he said "I love to write". I go "Honestly you're a fantastic writer, why don't you not do the other things?". And once he started doing that he was much happier. And frankly the rest of the team got better because if you have somebody who can do each one of those things they're a better team.*

*So I look for diversity, it's a big big thing.*
