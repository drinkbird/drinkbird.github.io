Earlier this year I attended the Voxxed Days Athens conference and had the pleasure to meet [John Papa](https://johnpapa.net/).

After his inspiring keynote talk about readable code, I got to pick John's brain and get some wonderful career advice, which I'm excited to be sharing with you. 

From online courses to podcasts and coding style guides, John's contributions to the dev community always stand out and provide great value, and this interview is no exception.
