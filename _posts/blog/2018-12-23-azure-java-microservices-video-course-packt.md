I'm excited to announce that my course *Microservices Development on Azure with Java* has been released by Packt Publishing.

Although the code examples are in Java, you can easily translate the demonstrated patterns to other platforms, such as dotnet core.

You can find out more and get the full course at one of the following channels:

- [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/microservices-development-azure-java-video)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/microservices-development-on-azure-with-java/)
- [Safari Books Online (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/microservices-development-on/9781789808858/)

This course will jumpstart your journey of building, deploying and operating containerized Java microservices into the cloud, using Docker and the Azure Kubernetes Service, while leveraging several building blocks of an open and flexible cloud platform that provides excellent support for Java.

Microservices have been adopted by the industry as a significant approach to building applications, and this course will show you a number of patterns that fit naturally into that architectural style.

Along the way, you will get introduced to a number of DevOps practices that will help you manage the full lifecycle of your application, from laptop to cloud and into the hands of your customers, while using state of the art tooling that comes out of the box with Azure.

Includes lots of great technologies like Azure DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, SendGrid, Azure Cosmos DB, Redis and much more.
