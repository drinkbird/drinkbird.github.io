*Which programming language should I learn first?* This is perhaps the most popular question of all time in software development.

Becoming proficient in a programming language, especially your first one, is a long-term process that requires significant volumes of study and practice. It's only natural that you want to make the best choice possible for your career, and to avoid putting all that hard work on the *wrong* option.

I'm not referring to the languages you would use in college out of necessity, as these are more or less imposed by a given curriculum. I'm talking about the one you intend to use at your first job, the one that will put the first buck in your pocket as a professional software developer.

The good news is that no matter how tricky it appears to be, making the *right* choice is not as important as you think. The truly important part is making *a* choice and sticking to it. Let me elaborate.

# Commitment is king

Imagine that you're driving to the mall on a Saturday morning, and as soon as you arrive you realize that the parking lot is almost full. What do you do after you find a spot and park your car? Do you look for more spots? Do you try a few different ones to see which one works out the best? Or do you simply lock your car and go shopping?

The parking spot is just a means to an end. Focusing too much on that would be a waste of your time, and would keep you from doing what you actually came to do. A programming language is also a means to an end.

Your purpose as professional software developers is not the act of software development itself, but rather solving problems and delivering value to real people *through* developing software. The longer it takes to pick your tool and learn it well, the less effective you're going to be in delivering value.

And trying to master multiple languages at once is not such a good idea. It's like chasing rabbits;

> Try chasing two rabbits at the same time and both will get away.

You might read this and think, "I don't want to pigeonhole myself into a single language, I want to leave all options open. And what if my choice is not the right one?".

Personally, I'd rather commit to the *wrong* language from the very beginning than delay and commit to the *right* one half way.

# My language is better than yours

There's a war out there. Companies developing programming languages, frameworks and other solutions, want you to pledge your loyalty to them. It's mostly through marketing that they try to push your brain into formulating certain perceptions about technology, and how their offerings fit perfect into the puzzle.

On the other hand, most software developers enjoy debating and arguing about technology. They all have invested their time and energy into specific programming languages and other technologies, and it's only natural that they are quite passionate when it comes to defending their choices.

Trying to read between the lines and figure out what is actually going on in the industry, especially with such a high signal-to-noise ratio, is profoundly challenging. Due to that mess, every once in a while you may catch yourself questioning your language choice.

This usually happens after watching or talking to someone who appears to be successful in the field but works with a different language. In some cases, that person may even express negative opinions about the language you happen to work with; it happens quite often when dealing with competing technologies.

# Only conscious choices matter

, no matter how much greener the grass looks in your neighbor's yard.

The grass is always greener elsewhere.


Avoid the urge of questioning whether that choice was the best one or not, and just focus on getting the most out of it. It's through commitment that you'll be able to grow, evolve and deliver value. The alternative is getting stuck to a limbo state considering your options and spreading your energy among multiple languages.











It's imperative that you make a choice and commit to it as early as possible. Avoid the urge of questioning whether that choice was the best one or not, and just focus on getting the most out of it. It's through commitment that you'll be able to grow, evolve and deliver value. The alternative is getting stuck to a limbo state considering your options and spreading your energy among multiple languages.



Energy is like jam; the more you spread it the thinner it gets. 









 Make the most out of your choice




 There's no greater distraction in software development than 






Start your career with a bang by committing to one language. Commitment is king. And you need to be committed from the start.

your goal is not practicing software development. Your goal is to produce value for real people through delivering some software.




to produce value for real people through the , 


 We use a language to help us deliver value to real people, not for the sake of practicing software development.






 The intention is not practicing software development itself, but rather delivering value to real people through the produced software.

By not making a choice early enough and committing 100% to it, you derail yourself from accomplishing your true goal.













Maybe you're considering the possibility of leaving all options open and not *pigeonhole* yourself into a single language, thinking that you'd otherwise be excluding yourself from a great number of job opportunities.














Sometimes this choice is never made, so people focus on becoming proficient in a number of different languages.
Some other times people invest long term on a language, only to switch to another one later


As you're reading this, you might be thinking that it's way more preferable to learn the basics for many different languages, and 


You may not see it yet, but becoming a specialist has immense value over becoming a generalist.


## Becoming a specialist


Why some people on the internet think of that language as a bad choice? What if the language of choice is not - or does not become - popular enough? What if it's not much fun to work with compared to other languages?



Although each language has its pros and cons




The grass is always greener elsewhere. Or is it?
