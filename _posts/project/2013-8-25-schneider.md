[Schneider Electric](http://www.schneider-electric.com) develops connected technologies and solutions to manage energy and process in ways that are safe, reliable, efficient and sustainable.

This mobile application & web portal was developed by [SiEBEN](http://www.sieben.gr) on behalf of [Schneider Electric SA](http://www.schneider-electric.com). It is aimed to offer exclusive benefits to the company's Accredited Partners through the i-NRG4U rewarding scheme. Partners are able to order products online, check out the exclusive offers of the month as well as their point balance, and finally redeem their points.

My role as a software developer included:

* Extracting technical specifications from the client's business documents.
* Designing and developing the solution's REST API using Microsoft Web API and Dynamics CRM. The API was designed in such a way so that both the web portal and the mobile application could use it to exchange data with Dynamics CRM in a standardized fashion. Also it was designed to be hosted on Azure Cloud Services, allowing it to be highly available and automatically scale on demand.
