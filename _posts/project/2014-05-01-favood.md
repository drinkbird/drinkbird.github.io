This mobile application & web portal was developed by [SiEBEN](http://www.sieben.gr) on behalf of [Favood Ltd](https://gust.com/companies/favood-ltd).

This online service's main goal is to help consumers locate packaged food as they are on diet (allergies, diabetes) or they are changing residence or as tourists who are looking for local food.

My role as a software developer included:

* Extracting some technical specifications from the client's business documents.
* Designing and developing the solution's REST API using Microsoft Web API and Dynamics CRM. The API was designed in such a way so that both the web portal and the mobile application could use it to exchange data with Dynamics CRM in a standardized fashion. Also it was designed to be hosted on Azure Cloud Services, allowing it to be highly available and automatically scale on demand.
