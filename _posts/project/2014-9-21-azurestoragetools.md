DrinkBird's *Azure Storage Tools* is a open source class library built on top of Azure Storage SDK, allowing an application to communicate with Azure Storage using a higher level of abstraction. 

For example, instead of using `String` as a queue message type, an application is able to use proper class models, handling the serialization/deserialization process behind the scenes.
