During my time in Walmart I have delivered several critical systems while improving processes, eliminating bottlenecks, and embracing a strong DevOps culture.

My contributions have led to direct savings of over $20m, the reduction of production incidents to a historical minimum, and the creation of 3 new full-blown teams.

Some of the projects in my portfolio are:
* [Associate delivery](http://bit.ly/assocdeliv)
* Delivery estimation & customer promise
* Shipment tracking
* Yard management - optimization of inbound/outbound shipments in fulfilment centers
* [Ship from store: US, Mexico, Canada](http://bit.ly/shipfs)
* [Seamless returns](http://bit.ly/smreturns)
* [Shipment management solution with direct integration to carriers & extended fulfilment capabilities](http://bit.ly/fbywmt)
* Competitive Intelligence data platform

As a Technical Lead, my top 3 responsibilities were to:
* Design cloud-native systems, gather feedback, iterate and drive them to completion in a lean/agile fashion
* Facilitate communications with stakeholders, other teams and functions (build trust, plan work, set expectations, provide estimates, report progress, eliminate waste, improve outcomes) often by traveling across sites
* Work with engineers of all levels to help them take both their soft and hard skills to the next level and grow professionally

Some of the practices and technologies utilized:
* Cloud-native development, Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps, Microservices, Event Sourcing, Data Engineering, DDD, CI/CD
* Distributed Systems, Azure, GCP, Kafka, Kafka Connect, Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, Nomad, Scala, Java, F#, C#, CosmosDB, Cassandra, SQL Server, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, BigQuery, REST, GraphQL/Protobuf, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Dynatrace, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Slack bots, Git, Swagger, API Design, Jira
